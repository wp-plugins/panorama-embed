== Description ==

Panorama Embed allows you to show panoramas or virtual tours in you blog, either inline, or linked by a picture.
See demo and description at <a href="http://gpwrite.com/panorama-embed-for-wordpress/">Wordpress Panorama Plugin</a>

== Installation ==

Upload the Panorama Embed plugin to your blog, and activate it. Set the size of your embedded panoramas on the Admin Page.
Upload your panoramas or virtual tours, each in their own directory, or use existing panoramas.
Add shortcode panoembed in your posts. More info on the Admin settings page of the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. screenshot-1.gif is the Settings Page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use any type panorama or virtual tour? =

Probably yes, because the panorama is either in an iframe, or new window.

= Can I use the plugin with the panoramas I already uploaded? =

Probably yes. You can use the shortcode to point to a directory 
(containing a default file, such as index.html or index.php) or
an individual file in a directoy.

= What files should I use to link to with the short code? =

It is advised to link to webpage, a webpage that includes al nescesary files
to show the panorama, java scripts, xml files etc etc. But it should be
a "clean" web page, that shows the panorama at 100% width and 100% height.
(unless you need otherwise)
